- [ ] gui: ssa: show block continuations

- [ ] fix <bug:let!>
- [ ] fix: if syntax with "pending else"
- [ ] fix: Phi's should always be named (probably with a special syntax)
- [ ] fix: StoreMem's results should probably always be hidden. Why are they even in the SSA?
    - vestige from the sea-of-nodes experiment?

- [ ] add scrollarea in SSA view

- [ ] remove horizontal padding/margin in ast's Flow seqs

- [ ] better syntax for deref

- [ ] cross-view highlighting
    - when hovering a register/block, highlight every corresponding item in every view (both same view and the others)

- [ ] highlight full blocks, too

- [ ] arbitrary block ordering for AST
    - eventually going to become user-editable
