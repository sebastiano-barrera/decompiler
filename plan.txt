- [x] gui: ssa: show block continuations
- [x] gui: ssa: add scrollarea

- [ ] ssa: switch to a fully scheduled IR
    - [x] disable xform
    - [--] replace Schedule with a dummy
    - [ ] refactor
        - remove Schedule
    - [ ] restore eliminate_dead_code
    - [ ] feature: add instructions
        - [ ] cfg: add new block
            - this probably requires a slightly less efficient representation where blocks are easy to cut and stitch
    - [ ] re-enable xform

- [ ] ssa: find a way to attach instructions to blocks!
    - right now, only effectful instructions are attached to blocks in a
    specific order, while pure instructions are scheduled only if and when it's
    strictly necessary, by ordering them in RPO.

    however, there is a bug:
        - if insn rX is used (directly or indirectly) by two effects located in
        two distinct blocks, then the scheduling algorithm will NOT place them
        in a common ancestor.

        the easy way out: fix the scheduling algorithm.

            - use lists:
                - probably necessary
                - we don't want them in general
                - ... i guess we could make a temporary one just for scheduling

            - basically S-o-N's Global Code Motion
                - or is it?

        - switching to an IR design where every instruction is attached to a block creates
        a challenge around adding new instruction: we need to make space for them!

- [ ] auto add parentheses based on operator precedence

- [ ] fix <bug:let!>
- [ ] fix: if syntax with "pending else"
- [ ] fix: Phi's should always be named (probably with a special syntax)
- [ ] fix: StoreMem's results should probably always be hidden. Why are they even in the SSA?
    - vestige from the sea-of-nodes experiment?


- [ ] remove horizontal padding/margin in ast's Flow seqs

- [ ] better syntax for deref

- [ ] cross-view highlighting
    - when hovering a register/block, highlight every corresponding item in every view (both same view and the others)

- [ ] highlight full blocks, too

- [ ] arbitrary block ordering for AST
    - eventually going to become user-editable
