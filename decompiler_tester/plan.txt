- [x] API for exposing every chunk of the decompiler's results

- [ ] dedicated views for:
    - [x] assembly (input)
    - [ ] function type
    - [x] mil
    - [ ] cfg
    - [x] ssa
    - [x] decompiled ast

    - [x] dwarf parsing details (warnings)
        - details about parsed types?
        - search?

- [--] allow disabling/enabling xforms
    - actually, we just keep around a pre-xform copy of the ssa, so you can just view both

- [x] fix: call results are not named?
- [x] selection: pin on click, only preview on hover
- [ ] selection: blocks
    - [ ] full highlight in ssa
    - [ ] references in ssa, ast
- [ ] highlight MIL instruction
- [ ] ast: precedence + grouping
- [ ] ast: better syntax for deref
    - [ ] remove padding?
- [ ] ast: ancestral always inline
- [ ] xform: eliminate upsilons referencing dead phis
- [ ] ssa: fix: show value not data type name! (misunderstood how facet's to_string works)
- [ ] show type info
    - [ ] function prototype
    - [ ] ssa: value types
    - [ ] ast: value types
- [ ] ast: show function names (should be correctly identifier by decompiler core)

- [ ] open executable from GUI
- [ ] show progress when parsing executable

- [ ] robust against panics in the decompiler
    - we mostly got it; there might be a hole or two somewhere
- [ ] multiple functions (tabs?)
