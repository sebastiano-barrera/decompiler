- [x] API for exposing every chunk of the decompiler's results

- [ ] dedicated views for:
    - [x] assembly (input)
    - [ ] function type
    - [x] mil
    - [ ] cfg
    - [x] ssa
    - [x] decompiled ast

    - [x] dwarf parsing details (warnings)
        - details about parsed types?
        - search?

- [--] allow disabling/enabling xforms
    - actually, we just keep around a pre-xform copy of the ssa, so you can just view both

- [x] fix: call results are not named?
- [x] selection: pin on click, only preview on hover
- [x] selection: blocks
    - [x] full highlight in ssa
    - [x] references in ssa, ast
    - [x] full highlight on MIL
- [x] highlight MIL instruction

- [x] fix: make the `facet` dependency (&co.) be the correct one for the Rust
compiler version
    - turns out, this is actually fine for recent enough compiler versions
    (the ones I use, anyway)

- [x] ast: precedence + grouping
- [x] ast: better syntax for deref
- [x] ast: ancestral always inline
- [x] ssa: fix: show value not data type name! (misunderstood how facet's to_string works)
- [-] ast: allow any node to be linked to highlighting
    - bailed out.
        - it's completely unclear how to manage focus and events with nested widgets like
        these (especially hover/click events)
        - also, it's kinda complex (but workable)
        - and I don't really need it anyway
- [x] ast: link other bits of syntax to ssa (e.g., bin ops)
- [x] ast: fix colors
- [x] ast: scroll-to when selecting something
- [?] xform: eliminate upsilons referencing dead phis
    - actually not sure that this is needed at all
- [x] merge selection colors mgmt in ast and ssa
- [x] always inline consts
- [x] never inline phis
- [ ] fix: DCE gets phi/upsilon elimination wrong sometimes
    - testcase: redisReconnect, near `ret` at 0x595118
- [ ] ast: show function names (should be correctly identifier by decompiler core)
- [ ] show type info
    - [ ] function prototype
    - [ ] ssa: value types
    - [ ] ast: value types
- [ ] ast: remove some horizontal padding
- [ ] ast: do not show StoreMem effect
    (actually, probably better to just handle effects differently in general)

- [ ] open executable from GUI
- [ ] show progress when parsing executable

- [ ] robust against panics in the decompiler
    - we mostly got it; there might be a hole or two somewhere
- [ ] multiple functions (tabs?)
